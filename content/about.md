## I'm Max!

I'm a game designer with a focus in Systems. I love making making new interactions for players to test out and making it feel good to play in the process!

## Experience

While at Champlain College, I've spent multiple semester making projects with teams of various sizes to make fun and unique games. These include FincrementalOS, a incremental fishing game, Cthulhu and Me, a pseudo-roguelike third-person shooter.
